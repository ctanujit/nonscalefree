# Searching for a new probability distribution for modeling non-scale-free heavy-tailed real-world networks

In this study, we consider large scale network data sets from different disciplines, namely social networks, collaboration networks, web graphs, citation networks, biological networks, product co-purchasing networks, temporal networks, communication networks, ground-truth networks, and brain networks. We study several individual data sets from each discipline. These data sets are publicly available at http://snap.stanford.edu/data/index.html

The "models_R" file contains the implementation of popularly-used degree distributions, namely Lomax, power-law, power-law with cutoff, Log-normal, and Exponential distributions. 
Furthermore, the file also contains the implementations of our proposed "Generalized Lomax" family of distributions, namely GLM Type-I, GLM Type-II, GLM Type-III and GLM Type-IV models. The decsirptions of all these models are provided in the manuscript titled "Searching for a new probability distribution for modeling non-scale-free heavy-tailed real-world networks".
